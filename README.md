# PROJECTS LIST AND SPECIFICATIONS

## RPi 5

### kernel8

This is a minimal setup with only 2 files, just enough for the Raspberry Pi to boot. It quickly does the Pythagorean Theorem, then loads into an infinite loop to prevent garbage execution.

To run you need:
- config.txt
- kernel8.img

loaded onto a MicroSD. This MicroSD will be put in the Pi 5, then booted.

## RPi PICO

### Cobalt

A custom MicroPython interpreter for a custom language named Cobalt. It can manipulate GPIO pins on the Pico and can build a variety of things, provided you learn the specifications. A README will be in the folder with all instructions listed for the language.
